To work with a Myntra dataset in scikit-learn, follow these steps:
1. Get the Data:
Web Scraping:
If the dataset isn't readily available, you can scrape it from the Myntra website using libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
Download:
Check for publicly available Myntra datasets on platforms like Kaggle or GitHub.
2. Load the Data:
Pandas: Use pandas to read the dataset into a DataFrame.
CODE->
    import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("myntra_dataset.csv")

3. Explore and Clean the Data:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use pandas functions like df.head(), df.describe(), df.info(), and visualizations (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to understand the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
4. Feature Engineering:
Text Features: Convert text data (e.g., product descriptions) into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec).
Categorical Features: Encode categorical features (e.g., brand, color) using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Numerical Features: Normalize or standardize numerical features if required.
5. Model Building:
Choose a Model: Select the appropriate scikit-learn model for your task (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).
Split Data: Divide your dataset into training and testing sets.
CODE->
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = df[['feature1', 'feature2', ...]] 
y = df['target_variable']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

6. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate Performance: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or RMSE to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

CODE->
     from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

. Model Tuning:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV.
Example Task: Product Recommendation
Data:
Use product features (e.g., category, brand, color, description) to build a recommendation system.
Model:
Consider using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.
Important Considerations:
Dataset Size:
If the dataset is large, consider using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE.
Feature Selection:
Select relevant features to improve the model's performance and interpretability.
Model Interpretation:
Understand the model's predictions and identify important features using techniques like feature importance or SHAP values.
